A challenge to recreate a figma design of a modern, responsive web application for generating random numbers with smooth animations and an elegant user interface. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring both mobile and desktop layouts.

## ✨ Features

- **Random Number Generation**: Generate between 1-1000 random numbers
- **Custom Range Selection**: Define minimum and maximum values for the lottery
- **No Repetition Option**: Toggle to prevent duplicate numbers
- **Animated Results**: Numbers appear one by one with beautiful animations
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop devices
- **Modern UI**: Gradient borders, smooth transitions, and interactive elements

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Set Parameters**: Enter how many numbers you want to generate
2. **Define Range**: Choose the minimum and maximum values
3. **Configure Options**: Toggle whether to allow repeated numbers
4. **Generate**: Click "Sortear" to start the animated number generation
5. **View Results**: Watch as numbers appear with spinning animations
6. **Restart**: Use "Sortear Novamente" to generate new numbers

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup structure
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with custom properties, flexbox, grid, and animations
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Interactive functionality and number generation logic

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser
3. Start generating random numbers!

No build process or dependencies required - it's a pure vanilla web application.
